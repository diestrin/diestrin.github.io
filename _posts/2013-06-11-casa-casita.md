### What's Casa Casita?

Well, in simple words, casa casita (*house, little house?*) are just two words I use for testing some code, it's like my own *Hello World*, and this is about what this bog is related, to test some code, learn some new stufs and, maybe, to help someone :)

The blog by itself is a test, I'm writing this lines in a .md file ([markdown](http://daringfireball.net/projects/markdown/)) and the blog is been hosted by [GitHub pages](http://pages.github.com/) running [Jekyll](http://jekyllrb.com/).

So thank you very much for take a look a this little post, and I hope to see you more often here. Check out the source code at [GitHub](https://github.com/diestrin/diestrin.github.io)
